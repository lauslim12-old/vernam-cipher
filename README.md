## Architecture / Philosophies
* Object Oriented
* Following Python's Recommended Project Structure
* Coded in English

## Features
* Encrypt a word using Vernam Cipher Algorithm.
* Decrypt a word using Vernam Cipher Algorithm.
* Run a full-test to show how Vernam Cipher Algorithm works.

## Project Structure
* The `vernam` folder is the source code of the Vernam Cipher Algorithm.

## Installations and Usage
* There's no dependencies, currently. Just do `git clone`.
* Change directory to your cloned repository.
* Do `cd vernam`, then just run `python vernam_cipher.py` to run the application.
* You're done!
